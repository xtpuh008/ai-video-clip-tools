## How long does AI clip generation actually take?

Most AI video clipping tools process a 60-minute video in 5-15 minutes, with results varying based on video length, resolution, and platform server load. Upload time depends on your internet connection, while AI analysis happens on cloud servers. Platforms like Klap and Vmaker AI emphasize speed, often delivering clips in under 10 minutes for standard podcast-length content. More complex analysis that includes virality scoring, keyword research, and multi-language captioning may extend processing to 15-20 minutes for comprehensive results.

## Can these tools handle videos with multiple speakers and camera angles?

Yes, advanced platforms like Vizard.ai and Spikes Studio include speaker identification and scene detection specifically for multi-person content. The AI recognizes different voices, tags speakers, and maintains proper framing when camera angles switch between participants. Chopcast offers dedicated clip-by-speaker functionality, letting you extract segments featuring specific individuals from panel discussions or interview formats. This capability proves essential for podcasts, webinars, and conference recordings where multiple people contribute throughout the content.

## Do AI-generated clips perform better than manually edited ones?

AI-generated clips perform comparably when platforms analyze successful content patterns, with tools like Opus.pro's Virality Score providing data-driven selection that often outperforms gut instinct. The advantage isn't necessarily quality but volume and consistency—AI lets you test 10+ clips from one video instead of manually creating 2-3, then double down on proven performers. Manual editing still wins for highly stylized content requiring specific creative vision, but automated tools excel at maintaining regular posting schedules and identifying unexpected viral moments human editors might overlook.
